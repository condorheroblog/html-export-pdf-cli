	<p style="margin-top:10rem;margin-bottom:10rem;">What happens when an impromptu question is sent to NYPL staff in honor of August 9th  “National Book Lovers Day”?

		“What is your favorite book? Pick one: One that you've read again and again, or that had a profound impact in your life.”

		It becomes a great conversation starter with amazing recommendations coming along and very touching moments shared - a very nice experience.

		<p>To Kill a Mockingbird is another classic novel, this time by Harper Lee. It's a story about race, justice, and morality in the Deep South. I love the book's themes of empathy, courage, and standing up for what's right.</p>

		<p style="margin-top:10rem;margin-bottom:10rem;">The Lord of the Rings is a classic fantasy novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. It's an epic tale of good versus evil, set in a richly imagined world filled with elves, dwarves, wizards, and hobbits. I love the book's themes of heroism, sacrifice, and the power of friendship.</p>
